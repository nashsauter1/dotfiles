#Called API
#Use "opengl" or "d3d11" (Windows only) if you have compatibility issues. 
# gpu-api=opengl

#Hardware decoding for whatever your CPU/GPU supports (e.g. 8bit h264 / 10bit h265)
#Use "auto-safe" or "auto-copy-safe"
#"Copy" methods are safer to use, but the performance difference is probably not as high and maybe not even worth over "no" (disabled).
#Manual options:
#Nvidia GPU: "nvdec"/"nvdec-copy" (Recommended)
#Windows: "dxva2-copy" or "vulkan"/"vulkan-copy"
#Linux: "vaapi"/"vaapi-copy" or "vulkan"/"vulkan-copy"
# hwdec=no

# Audio
## Default volume of the player
volume=75

#Max volume of the player

#Load external audio with (almost) the same name as the video

#Allow only mpv to send direct audio signals to the soundbar
#You need to activate "exclusive mode" in your sound driver on Windows
#This is highly recommended for a multi channel soundbar
# audio-exclusive=yes

#Channels that your device supports
#"auto-safe" only sends channels that your active audio device can handle, which can cause issues for an ARC/eARC setup (uses TV instead of soundbar) 
#"auto" sends every channels as they're, which works for an eARC/ARC setup but also can cause issues if your sound device doesn't support certain channel setups
#An alternative is to set up a whitelist for supported channels
# audio-channels=stereo,5.1,7.1

#Adds audio delay if you're watching with your headphones on PC (headphone jack) instead of TV (HDMI) output and notice some audio delay
#You have to adjust the value (ms)
audio-delay=+0.084

#Passthrough audio without encoding to PCM to your soundbar/soundsystem
#Remove codecs your soundbar doesn't support

#Won't work together with "video-sync=display-resample"
# audio-spdif=ac3,dts,eac3,dts-hd,truehd

#Converts any audio with three or more channels to AC3 (for spdif support)
#This is useful if you use spdif or HDMI ARC (instead of eARC) to get multi channel support (5.1/7.1 PCM not possible)
#It also can be used in general for all audios (stereo support with "minch=2"), but this isn't recommended (lossy to lossy conversion reduces the audio quality).
#Set "bitrate=auto" if you notice audio issues
#Won't work together with "video-sync=display-resample"
# af="lavcac3enc=bitrate=640:minch=3"

#Dynamic range compression (DRC)
#In theory, turns quieter stuff loader and loader stuff quieter
